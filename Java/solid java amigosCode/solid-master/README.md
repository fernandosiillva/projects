## SOLID 

- Single Responsibility
Each class should have only one sole purpose, and not be filled with excessive functionality

- Open Closed
Classes should be open for extension, closed for modification.
In other words, you should not have to rewrite an existing class for implementing new features.

- Liskov Substitution
Let Φ(x) be a property provable about objects x of type T. Then Φ(y) should be true for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.
This means that every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class

- Interface Segregation
Interfaces should not force classes to implement what they can’t do.
Large interfaces should be divided into small ones.

- Dependency Inversion
Components should depend on abstractions, not on concretions.
